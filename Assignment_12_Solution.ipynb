       "'BOD Primer\\nPage 5 of 61Respirometric BOD n determination\\nThe determination of the BOD concerns the determination of the degradation of organic\\nsubstances by microorganisms.The main application of respirometric BOD\\nn determination lies in the analysis of\\nwastewater in wastewater treatment plants. Respirometric measurement in a bottlecorresponds to the processes in a wastewater treatment plant, but on a greatly reduced\\nscale. At the same time, the analysis can be used for various aqueous media, e.g. in\\nflowing or standing surface waters and in natural as well as artificial waters.\\nThe measurement period can vary widely. For the classification and evaluation of the\\ndegradation performance of a wastewater treatment plant (with the exception of someScandinavian countries), it is customary to specify the BOD\\n5. In this case, the analysis\\ntime is 5 days. During this time, the measurement solution must be incubated at 20°C,\\ni.e. the sample bottle is thermostatted to (20 ± 1)°C in an incubator for the entire\\nmeasurement duration.Some Scandinavian countries specify the BOD\\n7 value. In a seven-day incubation\\nperiod, a measurement that is started on Tuesday is also completed on Tuesday;however, in a BOD\\n5 measurement, it is completed on Sunday. And who wants to go into\\nthe wastewater treatment plant on a Sunday to read the measured values! In the daysof the mercury manometer, the BOD\\n7 measurement offered a distinct advantage as\\nmeasurements could be made on practically any day. The use of the OxiTop\\uf8e8 system\\nnow also makes this possible for the BOD 5 measurement because it automatically\\nstores the measured values. The measured values, even those recorded on Sundaysand holidays, can be read just as well several days later. A further advantage of the\\nOxiTop\\n\\uf8e8 system is, moreover, the mercury-free pressure measurement. Many laws and\\nregulations namely call for the avoidance of chemicals and substances that are injuriousto health!'"

      "The city of Varanasi has been denoted by different names at different times in different contexts. The word Kashi means 'Concentration of Cosmic Light'. Generally, the city is known for its temples and ghats; historical records tell us about the importance and significance of the various Ponds, Kunds, Talabs, etc. The Laxmi Kund was initially known as Laxman Kund and near to it were the Ram Kund and Suraj Kund. Many religious activities are performed on auspicious occasions on the bank of these sacred ponds. The Kund is associated with Goddess Laksmi, the \"Goddess of wealth\". On the 8th of the waxing fortnight of Bhadrapada (August-September), the goddess moves from the sanctum to the foreground. And, on the 16th day, a religious fair is held there called \"Sorahia Mela\". In 2017 ONGC, a Maharatana company in India took the responsibility of restoring the ancient Kunds of Varanasi as their CSR. It was added to the HRIDAY scheme. \n",
